# LLM Prompts
Prompts for ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, etc.

*N.B. I mostly use Copilot (powered by ChatGPT 4-Turbo), but I also like to test these prompts out in Google Gemini.*

### Notes

#### Style

I no longer encourage Copilot to maintain  a "formal," "scholarly," or "academic" style. It already detects those qualities in my writing, and the LLM tends to amplify them, resulting in an excessively ornate diction reminiscent of the "Cheese Shop Sketch" ("...to negotiate the vending of some cheesy comestibles").

#### Clarity and Readability

I removed

> - Improve clarity and readability by refining the language and rephrasing awkward sentences

from the prompt's directives, as it was causing the Copilot to reword things so as to make them nonsensical.

## Software Documentation Editing Prompt

Act as an experienced technical editor. Upon receiving text from me, provide revisions that:
- Correct any typographical and grammatical errors
- Avoid repetitive use of words
- Refrain from using the word "utilize"
- Do not contain contractions
Display a table with my original text on the left and the suggested changes on the right.
Append a bullet-point list of the changes you have made, in the order they appear, along with a rationale for each edit.
Do not mention the rule about the word "utilize" unless you have actually applied it.
At the end, ask me for another passage to edit.
